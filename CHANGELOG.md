# Changelog

All notable changes to StellarCore are documented in this file.

ships. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#changelog) for how to add an entry
with your pull request.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Durable three-strike suppression for deterministic scheduled source failures, reviewed reactivation tooling, and aggregate exclusion of suppressed sources (#234).
- Deterministic scheduled evidence-pipeline fault-injection coverage with documented recovery/failure matrix (#171).
- Deployment-bound, secret-safe runtime configuration fingerprints with startup drift enforcement and release provenance binding (#214).
- Repository-wide raw SQL boundary auditing with reviewed allowlists, CI enforcement, and adversarial parameterization tests (#217).
- Canonical IDNA hostname identity for anchor registry, SEP-1, and outbound DNS trust decisions (#233).
- Read-only bounded integrity auditing for persisted evidence relationships and semantic invariants (#190).
- Versioned public API compatibility fixtures and CI breaking-change gates for anchors, corridors, rates, and reputation (#208).
- Typed startup runtime configuration validation with environment-specific requirements and secret-safe diagnostics (#175).
- GitHub issue template for proposing a new corridor to the StellarCore registry (#4).
- Exact asset identity enforcement and exact decimal arithmetic validation for normalized SEP-38 rate observations (#164).
- Hardened PostgreSQL pool management with bounded connection acquisition, TCP keepalive, connection lifetime recycling, and failover-aware stale-connection handling (#209).
- Database deadline and transaction-safety helpers for failover windows, including explicit ambiguous-commit reporting (#209).
- Isolated PostgreSQL wire-level failover tests covering outage, recovery, interrupted transactions, deadlines, and pool storm bounds (#209).
- Operational failover behavior and tuning guidance in `docs/database-failover.md` (#209).

### Fixed

- Prevented stale pooled PostgreSQL connections from being reused indefinitely after transient primary termination or endpoint rotation (#209).

- Public anchors and corridors APIs with reviewed, offline-auditable
  anchor/corridor registries.
- Reputation engine and public reputation API.
- Scheduled refresh for keeping rates and evidence current.
- Public dashboard and landing page, including rate-source, anchor-capability,
